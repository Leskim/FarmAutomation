Connect soil moisture sensor to get soil moisture readings
Add logic to pump water in low moisture and shut off to save on water 
Soil moisture readings should go to the server same as dhT11 readings


Pump 5v conecct inside water

Soil Moisture --- A0 ---> A0, VCC ---> 5V, GND ---> GND
Pump --- Red ----> Pin 4, Black ----> GND

Immerse pump in water


Still to do add logics for certain crops because all crops need different soil moisture content
Must incorporate with nodemcu to work though so the user can input the crop being planted
